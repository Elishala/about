        <p class="about-design">I believe that life is short &amp; that it is our responsibility to participate in making it beautiful.
          Good design is beautiful. Nature is beautiful. Authenticity is beautiful. I find
          that my detailed sensibilities work well with design &amp; project management. Also with proofreading. I appreciate being challenged
           because I believe that's when the magic of being &amp; creating something inspiring has potential. Some other things about me:
            I love traveling. I have a husky &amp; together we run. I teach yoga. Yoga helps ground me, iron me out &amp; is something I return to.
             <span id="about-dev">I thoroughly enjoy working with a text editor, WordPress, HTML, SCSS, client relationships &amp; I'm passionate about the user experience.
