        <p class="about-design">I believe that life is short &amp; that it is our responsibility to participate in making it beautiful.
          Good design is beautiful. Nature is beautiful. Authenticity is beautiful. At heart, I design. I design &amp; I observe. I find
          that my detailed sensibilities work well with design &amp; project management. I appreciate being challenged because I believe
           that's when the magic of being &amp; creating something inspiring has potential. Some other things about me, I'm a dreamer. I love huskies. I'm working
           on being a runner. I teach yoga. Yoga helps ground me, iron me out, &amp; is something I return to. <span id="about-dev">I watch other people learn web development
             &amp; I see how it clicks for them. It doesn't quite click like that for me. I studied Front-End Engineering at The Iron Yard. For 12 weeks I spent 70-80 hours a week
          studying HTML, CSS, UX/UI, &amp; JavaScript. At work I use PHP in WordPress custom made themes. Although I'm not comfortable writing JS logic, I love being inside a
        text editor. </span></p>
