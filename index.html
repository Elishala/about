        <p class="about-design">I believe that life is short and that it is our responsibility to participate in making it beautiful.
          Good design is beautiful. Nature is beautiful. Authenticity is beautiful. I find
          that my detailed sensibilities work well with design, customer success and project management. Also with proofreading.
          I appreciate being challenged because I believe that's when the magic of being and creating
          something inspiring has potential. Some other things about me: I love traveling. I have a husky and together we run.
          I teach yoga. Yoga helps ground me, iron me out and is something I return to.
             <span id="about-dev">I thoroughly enjoy working with client relationships, a text editor, WordPress, HTML, SCSS,
                and I'm passionate about the user experience.
